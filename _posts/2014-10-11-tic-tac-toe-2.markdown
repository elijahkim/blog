Ok let's finally get started.

As I mentioned before, I started with the Player Class which would primarily
include a naming scheme and a method to input data. So here's how it started.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Player
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

I figured, I'd probably have to access the name in other places so I made the
name so I set that up instantly.

Cool.

Now let's make a method get_input. The method will ask for the player's x and
y coordinated and return them! Seems simple enough. Maybe something like this.

{% highlight ruby %}
def get_input
  puts "some statement"
  print "x: "
  x = gets.chomp.to_i
  print "y: "
  y = gets.chomp.to_i
  [y, x]
end
{% endhighlight %}

And that's the player class. 
Easy.
