For a lot of developers, working with a designer can sound daunting. Not only do
you have to work with a team (which leads to problems in itself), but you might
end up working with a front end dev that hasn't worked with your stack before.
This can really slow down your development process but in the end, it should all
be worth it. So to make the process easier, here are 5 tips to seamlessly work
with a front end dev.

###1. Be Humble###
As a Rails developer, I am pretty confident in my knowledge of how a MVC works
and how the business logic and the view logic are split into different areas.
But that does not mean that I have knowledge of how every framework works.
In the same way, your designer might have worked in another framework or maybe
even never worked with a framework at all!
Although to you, your framework seems
like common sense, to someone who has never worked in your framework, it is a
complete mystery. You must take the initiative and help your front end dev get
started.

Hopefully after showing your designer the inner workings of your framework, he
or she will know what to do from there. In the case where your designer needs
help down the road, be open to lending a hand. Your designer's hands are already
full with designing the whole website. 

###2. Pick your Battles###
Everyone has opinions on how an app should be designed. Some may be wrong but
that does not mean that 

###3. Be Verbal###

###4. Ask Questions###
