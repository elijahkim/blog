Apparently Tic Tac Toe is an easy program to make. However, each way I thought
about it, it didn't seam as easy as it sounded so I decided to at least have
this under my belt. This was my thought process.

What do I need?

I figured I would need at least a Game Class, a Player Class, and a Board Class.
By separating these classes, I was able to easily give each class methods so
that each class had only one job to do. In this case, the Player would be a
player and the Game would be the game and so on.

What do I need each class to do?

The Player Class was... well the player. It would take the X's and O's. Have
player names and be the sole communicator between the user and the program.

The Board Class was a bit more complicated. It needed to have a layout of a Tic
Tac Toe board, be able to display the current status of the board, and place moves
where needed.

The Game Class would need to basically be the Class that uses the two other
classes so that the player and the board could communicate with each other. It
basically served as a moderator. This Class would have to get moves and tell the
board what it was. Also, most of the game logic was in this class as well.

Now what?

I started with the Player Class. It seemed the simplest.
