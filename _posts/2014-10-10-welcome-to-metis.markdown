Three weeks has passed since Metis has started. I safely say that they were jam
packed with information. The first week was purely an intro to Ruby, the second
week was the beginning of web development through Sinatra, and this week we
finally started Rails.

What a journey it's been so far. Coming into the program, I had a few classes of
computer science under my belt. The little bit of Java I learned definitely
helped me get through the first week. Considering that Java is syntactically
much harder than Ruby, learning the basic concepts was a breeze. However,
pure theory was pretty much useless once we started building programs. 

I honestly don't have much to say. Each day felt like a lifetime, but when I
look back, it feels like the time has flown by. I learned so much in three weeks
and I hope I can retain all of it. In the next post I will start to explain a
tic tac toe app I built and hopefully later on, post improvements on it as well.
